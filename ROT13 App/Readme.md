### About Project
The ROT13 app is a GUI implementation of the original ROT13 encryption. This program is created by using the PyQT5 module on python with CSS styling! 

I created this program because I got bored with the terminal and decided to host my programs with a app kind of a interface. That is why I created this program. The designs and app interface is done by me while the encryption algorithm is done by Sam Allen. </br>
You can find the encryption code [here](https://www.dotnetperls.com/rot13-python) :)

### PyQT5 Introduction
The infamous PyQt5 is a python module that is used for Graphical User Interface[GUI] development. PyQt5 is packed with amazing basic yet interesting widgets which can be almost customizable in any form that you like! \
PyQt5 originally comes from the Qt v5 (*PyPI from 2021*)  which is framework that is generally focused on C++. For starters, the PyQt5 is still not perfect as that PyQt5 is no ordinary module with small tutorials and studies to master it. It requires a lot of learning and practice to master it. The PyQt5 Documentations are also not fully complete yet and the original wiki is focused on the C++. \
The Qt5 Framework do support Python language. It is thus recommended that you get along the basic stuff and move on to the interesting hardcore development.
</br>
Beside the raw coding, it is vital that you learn about these two software for creating applications of insane creativity! 

 1. [Qt Designer](https://www.qt.io/design)
 2. [Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io/product/development-tools) 
Install the pyqt5 module here!
```
pip install pyqt5
```


### How to run it?
ROT13 App program can be ran directly from the command shell.  </br>
~~~
C:\Python\python app.py // CMD
~~~
File Structure below 🔽

As you see above that the ROT13 APP has three files that are of upmost importance, The **design.css** file handles the professional widget designs. The **app_eng.py** is the main code as you can guess it. The **app_eng.py** can run without the **design.css ** file because the designs are optional for this build.   </br>
Why you ask?  </br>
Because the designs are required for impressions ヾ(•ω•`)o and also to give off the professional feeling at the same time. 
The third program is called the **resource.py** that is carrying the icons files required to give the app a home icon. Without the **resource.py**, the program would trackback an error. Basically the icons are converted from a .png file into a .qml data by using the [Qt resource system.](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/resources.html) </br>
You can learn how to design your GUI apps with using the Qt resource collection file with an example [here](https://realpython.com/python-menus-toolbars/) </br>
Apart from the 3 files, the another file is called the **app_jp.py** which is actually a 日本語 language version of the original program. 

In other words, just be sure to download the whole file folder. </br>
After that, you can access the app by using the terminal if you like or anyway of you to access a python script.
