# Project description
The Temperature Converter is a Graphical User Interaction(GUI) application that uses the PyQt5 library of Python to convert SI units of any scale into its corresponding values.

This is a Python project but the library comes as a inheritance of the Qt Engine that is developed for C++.





## Architecture of the Project

For reference, this is the Architecture that I made on the development of this project. Expect this to be developed in case that I missed something.

## Requirements

The Temperature Converter requires the latest version of PyQt5 and Python. The software also uses Webbrowser that is an extra lib which I added for fun.
