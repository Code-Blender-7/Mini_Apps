

The Mini Apps repo is the another version of the Small_Projects

Honestly, I wanted to make sure that I don't create a program so well developed as a Prototype since Small_Projects are for Not Fully Developed[NFD] Apps. 
But, I guess that a second Repo is perhaps needed for that. Mini_Apps Repository are for the programs that can be turned into Complete Fully Developed[CFD] Apps. 

I Really hope that you guys can create a cooler version of my projects. 
Some of this projects are rather done by me or they are done by another tutorial. 

My Programs are Open Sourced Licensed which means that you can use it for development. Unfortunately, you are forbidden to develop commercial apps that may generate revenue 
directly or indirectly. Should you want to develop, Please DM me on my Twitter. 


Should you find any problems, Comment on the code lines, Launch an ISSUE  and I be sure to check it out!
